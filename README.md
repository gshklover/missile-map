Crowd-sourced guided missile warning system

**Goal:**<br>
  Provide crowd-sourced **warning system against cruise missile attacks** over populated areas.

**Rationale:**<br>
  Cruise missiles are relatively slow moving targets that, never-the-less, pose significant threat due to low flying altitude and route changes.
  Low flying altitudes make detection and tracking of cruise missiles challenging for conventional anti-aircraft defence radars.

**Suggested solution:**<br>
* Use crowed-sourcing to track guided missiles
* A person with installed application will be able to report location & direction of observed missle
* Cloud server will process (authenticate, filter and aggregate) the reports and provide live map of known threats
