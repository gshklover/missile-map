Crowd-sourced guided missile warning system

**Goal:**<br>
  Provide crowd-sourced **warning system against guided missile attacks** over populated areas.

**Rationale:**<br>
  Guided missiles are relatively slow moving targets that, never the less, pose significant threat due to low flying altitude and route changes.
  Low flying altitudes make detection and tracking of guided missiles challenging for conventional anti-aircraft defence radars.

**Suggested solution:**<br>
* Use crowed-sourcing to track guided missiles
* A person with installed application will be able to report location & direction of observed missle
* Cloud server will process (authenticate, filter and aggregate) the reports and provide live map of known threats
